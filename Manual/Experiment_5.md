## Theory

Compressive strength is the most important property of cement and concrete. To ensure the quality of cement, 1:3 cement-sand mortar cubes are tested under compression. This strength is measured after curing for 3 and 7 days. According to IS: 269-1976, the minimum compressive strength for OPC mortar cubes (1:3) should be:

- **3 days**: Not less than **16.0 N/mm²**  
- **7 days**: Not less than **22.0 N/mm²**

The amount of water added is determined based on the standard consistency (P) of cement, using the formula:  
**Water content = (P/4 + 3)%** of the combined weight of cement and sand.

---

## Procedure

1. **Preparation of Mortar:**
   - Mix cement and standard sand in a ratio of 1:3 by weight.
   - Mix the dry components thoroughly.
   - Add calculated water content = (P/4 + 3)% of total dry weight.
   - Mix until a uniform paste is achieved.

2. **Filling the Mould:**
   - Place the mortar into clean cube moulds in two layers.
   - Compact each layer using a vibrating machine for 2 minutes.

3. **Initial Setting and Curing:**
   - Store the moulds in a moist environment (90% RH) for 24 hours at 27 ± 2°C.
   - After 24 hours, demould the specimens and place them in water for curing.

4. **Compressive Strength Testing:**
   - On the 3rd and 7th day, take the cubes out of water.
   - Wipe off surface moisture and place the cube in the CTM.
   - Apply load at a rate of 35 N/mm²/minute until failure.
   - Record the maximum load and compute compressive strength as:

   $$
   \text{Compressive Strength (σ)} = \frac{P}{A}
   $$

   Where:  
   \( P \) = Load at failure in Newtons  
   \( A \) = Cross-sectional area of cube = 70.5 mm × 70.5 mm = **4970.25 mm²**

## Observations and Calculations (Customize table as required)

| Sr. No. | 3-day Load (kN) | 3-day Strength (N/mm²) | 7-day Load (kN) | 7-day Strength (N/mm²) |
|--------:|----------------:|------------------------:|----------------:|------------------------:|
| 1       |                 |                         |                 |                         |

| 3       |                 |                         |                 |                         |
| **Avg.**|                 |                         |                 |                         |

## Result

- **3-day compressive strength** = ________ N/mm²  
- **7-day compressive strength** = ________ N/mm²

---

## Precautions

- Ensure uniform and proper mixing of mortar.
- Use moulds that are clean and lightly oiled before filling.
- Compact the mortar properly using a vibrating machine.
- Maintain the specified temperature and humidity during curing.
- Apply load gradually and steadily during testing.

## Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

Compressive strength reflects the quality and grade of cement. The use of standard sand and curing conditions ensures uniform testing across laboratories. This experiment is crucial for assessing the performance of different types of cement under realistic conditions. Results also assist in evaluating the suitability of cement for structural applications.
