## **Theory**

Flexural strength (modulus of rupture) is the ability of concrete to resist bending. It is especially important in structures like pavements and slabs, where tensile stresses due to bending govern performance.

### **Two-Point Loading (Standard Method – IS 516:2021)**

In this method, the beam is supported at both ends and loaded symmetrically at two points. If the fracture occurs within the middle third of the span:

> **f = (P × L) / (b × d²)**

If fracture occurs outside the middle third:

> **f = (3 × P × a) / (b × d²)**

Where *P* = failure load, *L* = span length, *a* = distance of fracture from support, *b* = beam width, *d* = depth.

### **One-Point Loading (Alternative Method)**

Here, load is applied at mid-span. Flexural strength is calculated as:

> **f = (3 × P × L) / (2 × b × d²)**

This method is less common and may give slightly higher strength values.

### **Empirical Formula (IS 456:2000)**

As a rough estimate, flexural strength can also be taken as:

> **f = 0.7 × √fck**

Where *fck* is the characteristic compressive strength of concrete.

## **Procedure**

1. Take standard size concrete beam specimens (e.g., 100×100×500 mm or 150×150×700 mm) after 28 days of curing.
2. Measure and record the actual dimensions of the beam.
3. Place the beam specimen on the supporting rollers with a clear span of 400 mm (for 100 mm width beam) or 600 mm (for 150 mm width beam).
4. Place the loading rollers symmetrically such that they divide the span into three equal parts.
5. Apply load gradually and uniformly without shock at a rate of 0.06 ± 0.04 N/mm²/min.
6. Note the maximum load (P) at which the beam fails.
7. Observe the location of the fracture line and measure the distance from the nearest support (a) if the fracture is outside the middle third.
8. Calculate the flexural strength using the appropriate formula.

## **Result**

* The **average flexural strength (modulus of rupture)** of concrete = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ N/mm²

---

## **Precautions**

* Ensure the beam specimen is cured properly and is free from surface cracks.
* Dimensions should be measured accurately before testing.
* Ensure correct alignment of loading and support rollers.
* Load should be applied gradually without shock.
* Fracture location must be noted to apply correct formula.

## **Discussion** *(For reference only; not to be written in notebook)*

Flexural strength is essential in the design of rigid pavements and other concrete elements where tensile stresses due to bending are significant. It generally lies between 10–20% of the compressive strength of concrete.

## **Questions** *(For reference only; not to be written in notebook)*

* What does modulus of rupture represent in concrete structures?
* Why is the span-to-depth ratio important in flexural tests?
* How does curing duration affect flexural strength?
* What if the fracture occurs outside the middle third?
