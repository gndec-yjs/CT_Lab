## Theory

Specific gravity of aggregates is the ratio of the weight of aggregate to the weight of an equal volume of water. It indicates the density and quality of aggregates and is essential for mix design calculations.

There are two types:  
- **Apparent Specific Gravity**: Based on the volume excluding water-permeable voids.  
- **Bulk Specific Gravity**: Based on the total volume, including permeable pores.

Water absorption indicates the amount of water the aggregate can absorb and reflects its porosity, affecting the workability and strength of concrete.

**Formulas:**  
- **Specific Gravity (G)**:  
  $G = \frac{W_2}{W_2 - W_3}$

- **Water Absorption (%)**:  
  $\text{Water Absorption} = \frac{W_2 - W_1}{W_1} \times 100$

Where:  
$W_1$ = weight of oven-dried sample (g)  
$W_2$ = weight of saturated surface-dry (SSD) sample (g)  
$W_3$ = weight of pycnometer + sample + water (g)  
$W_4$ = weight of pycnometer filled with water only (g)

## Procedure

1. Take a representative sample of fine aggregates (~500g) and wash it to remove dust and finer particles.
2. Dry the sample in an oven at 100–110°C for 24 ± 0.5 hours and cool to room temperature.
3. Immerse the dried sample in water for 24 hours and wipe it to a saturated surface-dry (SSD) condition.
4. Weigh the SSD sample ($W_2$).
5. Place the SSD sample into the pycnometer, fill with water up to the mark, and weigh ($W_3$).
6. Fill the empty pycnometer with water up to the mark and weigh ($W_4$).
7. Oven dry the sample again and weigh it ($W_1$).
8. Calculate specific gravity and water absorption using the recorded weights.

## Observations and Calculations (Customize the table, as required)

- **Specific Gravity (G)**:  
  $G = \frac{W_2}{W_2 - W_3}$

- **Water Absorption (%)**:  
  $\text{Water Absorption} = \frac{W_2 - W_1}{W_1} \times 100$

## Result

- **Specific Gravity of fine aggregate** = ________  
- **Water Absorption of fine aggregate** = ________ %

---

## Precautions

- Ensure aggregates are fully saturated but surface dry during weighing.
- Clean the pycnometer properly before each weighing.
- Maintain water at room temperature during the test.
- Avoid loss of material during transfer between containers.
- Carefully wipe off surface water without removing absorbed water.

## Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

Specific gravity indicates the density and quality of aggregates. Higher water absorption suggests higher porosity, affecting concrete strength and durability. Fine aggregates with low water absorption are preferred for high-strength concrete.

## Questions (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

- Why is surface-dry condition important before weighing?  
- What does high water absorption indicate about an aggregate?  
- Why is pycnometer preferred over other methods for fine aggregates?  
- What is the difference between bulk and apparent specific gravity?  
- How would specific gravity affect concrete mix design?
