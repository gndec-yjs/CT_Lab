## Theory

Specific gravity of aggregates is the ratio of the weight of aggregate to the weight of an equal volume of water. It indicates the density and quality of aggregates and is essential for mix design calculations.

There are two types:  
- **Apparent Specific Gravity**: Based on the volume excluding water-permeable voids.  
- **Bulk Specific Gravity**: Based on the total volume, including permeable pores.

**Water Absorption** indicates the amount of water the aggregate can absorb and shows its porosity. It affects the workability and strength of concrete.

**Formulas:**  
- **Specific Gravity (G)** =  
  $$
  G = \frac{W_2}{(W_2 - W_3)}
  $$
- **Water Absorption (%)** =  
  $$
  \text{Water Absorption (\%)} = \frac{W_2 - W_1}{W_1} \times 100
  $$

Where:  
\( W_1 \) = weight of oven-dried sample (g)  
\( W_2 \) = weight of saturated surface-dry (SSD) sample (g)  
\( W_3 \) = weight of pycnometer + sample + water (g)  
\( W_4 \) = weight of pycnometer filled with water only (g)

---

## Procedure

1. **Sample Preparation:**
   - Take a representative sample of fine aggregates (~500g).
   - Wash it to remove dust and finer particles.
   - Dry it in a hot air oven at 100–110°C for 24 ± 0.5 hours.
   - Cool in air to room temperature.

2. **Saturation of Sample:**
   - Immerse the sample in water for 24 hours.
   - Remove and wipe the surface with a moist towel to make it surface dry (SSD condition).

3. **Weighing:**
   - Weigh the SSD sample = \( W_2 \).

4. **Pycnometer Filling:**
   - Place the SSD sample in the pycnometer.
   - Fill the pycnometer with water up to the calibrated mark.
   - Weigh the pycnometer with the sample and water = \( W_3 \).

5. **Pycnometer without Sample:**
   - Empty and clean the pycnometer.
   - Fill it only with water up to the mark.
   - Weigh it = \( W_4 \).

6. **Oven-dry Sample Weighing:**
   - Oven dry the sample again and weigh it = \( W_1 \).

7. **Calculations:**
   - Use the recorded weights to compute specific gravity and water absorption.

## Result

- **Specific Gravity of fine aggregate** = ________  
- **Water Absorption of fine aggregate** = ________ %

---

## Precautions

- Ensure that aggregates are fully saturated but surface dry during weighing.
- Clean the pycnometer properly before each weighing.
- Maintain water at room temperature during the test.
- Avoid loss of material during transfer between containers.
- Wipe off excess surface water carefully without removing absorbed water.

## Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

Specific gravity provides information about the aggregate’s density and suitability for concrete. Higher water absorption indicates higher porosity, which may affect the strength and durability of concrete. Fine aggregates with low water absorption are preferred for high-strength concrete.

---

## Questions (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

- Why is surface-dry condition important before weighing?  
- What does high water absorption indicate about an aggregate?  
- Why is pycnometer preferred over other methods for fine aggregates?  
- What is the difference between bulk and apparent specific gravity?  
- How would specific gravity affect concrete mix design?
