## Theory

Bulking of sand refers to the increase in volume of sand when it contains moisture. Moisture forms a thin film around sand particles, pushing them apart and increasing the volume. This phenomenon is more pronounced in fine sand. Bulking can lead to incorrect volume batching if not accounted for during concrete mix preparation. The bulking is expressed as a percentage increase in volume compared to the dry volume of sand.

---

## Procedure

1. Take a sample of moist sand and loosely fill it in a 250 ml measuring cylinder up to a convenient mark (e.g., 200 ml). Record the volume (V₁).
2. Add sufficient water gradually to submerge the sand completely and stir gently with a glass rod to eliminate air voids.
3. Allow the sand to settle, and note the final volume after full saturation (V₂).
4. Calculate the percentage bulking using the formula:

   $$
   \text{Bulking percentage} = \left( \frac{V_1 - V_2}{V_2} \right) \times 100
   $$
5. Repeat the procedure 2–3 times and take the average value for better accuracy.

## Observations and Calculations

| Description                  | Value (ml) |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| Volume of moist sand (V₁)    |            |
| Volume after saturation (V₂) |            |
| **Calculated Bulking (%)**   |            |

$$
\text{Bulking percentage} = \left( \frac{V_1 - V_2}{V_2} \right) \times 100
$$

---

## Precautions

* Use uniformly graded clean sand.
* Avoid spilling material during the experiment.
* Stir gently to allow proper settlement.
* Take volume readings at eye level for accuracy.
* Ensure that the sand is moist but not saturated at the start.

## Result

* **Bulking of sand = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ %**

Certainly! Here's the **optional "Discussion" and "Questions"** section for **Experiment 11: Determine the Bulking of Sand**. These are **not to be written in the practical notebook**, but can be used for viva, classroom discussion, or understanding.

## **Discussion** *(For reference only; not to be written in notebook)*

Bulking of sand is a crucial phenomenon to understand during volume batching in concrete mix design. When sand contains moisture, a thin layer of water forms around each particle, causing them to repel each other slightly and increasing the total volume of the sand. This increased volume may lead to under-sanding in concrete if not accounted for, resulting in reduced workability and strength.

The extent of bulking is more prominent in fine sand compared to coarse sand due to the larger surface area of finer particles, which holds more water film and creates more separation. Bulking is typically observed up to 4–6% moisture content, beyond which the water starts filling the voids, and the volume begins to decrease as sand approaches saturation.

Understanding bulking is essential for accurate mix proportioning and for avoiding errors during field batching by volume.

## **Questions** *(For reference only; not to be written in notebook)*

1. Define bulking of aggregates and explain its significance in concrete mix design.
2. Why does bulking occur only in sand and not in coarse aggregates?
3. What is the effect of moisture content on the bulking of fine aggregate?
4. How does bulking differ between fine and coarse sands?
5. How can the effect of bulking be minimized in field batching?
6. What would happen if bulking is not accounted for during volume batching?
7. Explain why bulking decreases after a certain moisture content.
8. What type of sand (fine or coarse) would show more bulking and why?
