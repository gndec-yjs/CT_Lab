## **Theory**

Workability of concrete refers to its ability to be mixed, transported, placed, and finished without segregation. The slump test is one of the most common methods used to measure workability. The test measures the change in height of a concrete cone after it is lifted off, known as the "slump." A higher slump indicates a more workable mix (i.e., higher fluidity), while a lower slump indicates a stiffer mix.

According to **IS: 1199-2018**, the slump test is done by measuring the vertical subsidence of a fresh concrete sample after it is placed in a cone-shaped mould and removed.

* **Zero Slump**: Concrete is very stiff and cannot be worked easily.
* **True Slump**: Concrete maintains its shape and settles vertically.
* **Shear Slump**: Concrete shears off to one side indicating improper mixing or too much water content.

## **Procedure**

1. Place the slump cone on a smooth, non-porous base plate.
2. Ensure the cone is clean and free from any debris.
3. Fill the slump cone in three layers, each approximately one-third of the cone height.
4. Tamp each layer with a standard tamping rod of 16 mm diameter and 600 mm length with a rounded end (25 times for each layer).
5. After filling the cone, level the top using the trowel.
6. Lift the cone vertically without tilting, and place it aside.
7. Measure the difference in height between the top of the cone and the highest point of the slumped concrete.
8. Record the slump as the distance the concrete has subsided.
9. Repeat the test for consistency and to check repeatability of results.

## **Observations and Calculations**

| Sample No. | Slump (mm) | Concrete Mix Type (e.g., stiff, medium, or fluid) |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          |            |                                                   |
| 2          |            |                                                   |
| 3          |            |                                                   |
| **Avg.**   |            |                                                   |

## **Result**

* The **average slump** of the concrete = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ mm

---

## **Precautions**

* Ensure the slump cone is clean and placed on a level surface.
* Fill the cone in layers and tamp each layer properly.
* Measure the slump immediately after lifting the cone.
* Use a standard tamping rod and apply consistent tamping pressure.
* Avoid disturbing the concrete sample after it has settled.

## **Discussion** *(For reference only; not to be written in notebook)*

The slump test helps determine the workability of the concrete, which influences its ease of mixing, handling, and placement. A high slump is ideal for situations requiring high workability, while a low slump is more suitable for high-strength concrete where reduced workability is desired. This test is crucial for assessing concrete quality before its placement.

## **Questions** *(For reference only; not to be written in notebook)*

* What does the slump test measure in concrete?
* How does the water-cement ratio affect the slump value?
* Why is it important to measure slump immediately after lifting the cone?
* What are the different types of slump observed during the test?
* How does the size and shape of the slump cone affect the test results?
