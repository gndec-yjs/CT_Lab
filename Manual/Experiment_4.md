## Theory

The specific gravity of a material is the ratio of its mass to the mass of an equal volume of water. For cement, this test is commonly performed using a specific gravity bottle. Kerosene is used instead of water to avoid chemical reactions with the cement. The procedure involves measuring the mass of cement in a specific gravity bottle that is filled with kerosene.

---

## Procedure

1. Weigh the empty specific gravity bottle and record the mass as \( W_1 \) (in grams).
2. Fill the bottle with distilled water up to the mark and weigh the bottle again. Record the mass as \( W_2 \) (in grams).
3. Empty the bottle, clean and dry it, then fill it with kerosene up to the same mark. Weigh the bottle and record the mass as \( W_3 \) (in grams).
4. Weigh approximately 50 g of cement and introduce it into the bottle. Gently roll the bottle to remove any air bubbles. Fill the bottle to the top with kerosene and weigh it. Record the mass as \( W_4 \) (in grams).
5. Use the following formula to calculate the specific gravity of cement:

   $$
   \text{Specific Gravity of Cement} = \frac{(W_4 - W_3)}{(W_2 - W_1)} \times \frac{(W_3 - W_1)}{(W_4 - W_2)}
   $$

   Where:  
   \( W_1 \) = Mass of the empty specific gravity bottle  
   \( W_2 \) = Mass of the bottle with distilled water  
   \( W_3 \) = Mass of the bottle with kerosene  
   \( W_4 \) = Mass of the bottle with cement and kerosene

## Observations and Calculations

| Description                                   | Value        |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Mass of empty bottle \( W_1 \)                | ________ g   |
| Mass of bottle + distilled water \( W_2 \)    | ________ g   |
| Mass of bottle + kerosene \( W_3 \)           | ________ g   |
| Mass of bottle + cement + kerosene \( W_4 \)  | ________ g   |
| Specific Gravity of Cement                    | ________     |

---

## Result

Specific gravity of the cement = ________

---

## Precautions

- Ensure that the specific gravity bottle is clean and dry before use.
- Kerosene used should be free from water to avoid errors in calculation.
- Cement should be free from lumps to ensure uniformity in the results.
- Care should be taken to remove any air bubbles when adding cement to the bottle.
- The bottle should be filled to the mark for accurate measurements.

## Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

This method is based on measuring the mass of a fixed volume of the material (cement) and comparing it to the mass of an equal volume of water. The use of kerosene prevents reactions with the cement, ensuring accurate results. The specific gravity of cement is an important parameter in determining its suitability for various concrete applications, as it directly affects the cement's density and hydration properties.
Specific Gravity of OPC and PPC
According to the IS Code (IS 4031-1988, Part 11), the specific gravity of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) should typically range between 3.10 to 3.15. For Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC), the specific gravity typically ranges from 2.90 to 3.00.

These values are crucial as they help in determining the density of cement, which impacts the mix design for concrete. The specific gravity values are used to calculate the required amount of cement for various concrete applications. Higher specific gravity values indicate denser and heavier cement particles, while lower values generally indicate lighter cement.
