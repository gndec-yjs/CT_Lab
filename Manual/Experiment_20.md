## Theory

The rebound hammer test is a non-destructive method to assess the surface hardness of concrete, which correlates with its compressive strength. When the hammer's plunger is pressed against the concrete surface, a spring-controlled mass impacts the plunger, and the rebound distance is measured. This rebound number indicates the surface hardness and, by extension, the estimated compressive strength.

Factors influencing the rebound number include:

* Surface smoothness and moisture
* Type and size of aggregate
* Concrete age and curing conditions
* Orientation of the test (vertical, horizontal, or overhead)

---

## Procedure

1. Calibrate the rebound hammer using a steel anvil before starting the test to ensure accurate readings.
2. Clean the concrete surface to remove any dust, loose particles, or coatings. Make sure the surface is smooth and dry.
3. Hold the rebound hammer perpendicular to the test surface and press the plunger firmly against the concrete until the hammer impacts.
4. Record the rebound number shown on the scale or digital display.
5. Take at least 09 readings at each test location, discarding any outliers.
6. Calculate the average rebound number from the accepted values.
7. Use the correlation chart or graph provided with the hammer to estimate the compressive strength of concrete based on the average rebound number.

## Result

* **Average compressive strength (Rebound Hammer test)** = _________ N/mm²
* **Average compressive strength (Destructive test - CTM)** = _______ N/mm²

## Precautions

* Ensure the rebound hammer is properly calibrated before use.
* Test surfaces should be clean, smooth, and dry.
* Avoid testing near edges or corners of concrete elements.
* Maintain consistent orientation during testing.
* Discard any anomalous readings before calculating the average.

## Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

The rebound hammer test provides a quick and non-destructive means to estimate the compressive strength of concrete. While it offers convenience, results can be influenced by surface conditions and other factors. Therefore, it's advisable to use this method in conjunction with other testing methods for comprehensive assessment.

* What is the principle behind the rebound hammer test?
* How does surface moisture affect rebound numbers?
* Why is calibration of the rebound hammer necessary?
