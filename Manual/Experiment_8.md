## Theory

Bulk density (unit mass) of an aggregate is the mass of the material per unit volume, including the voids between the particles. The bulk density of an aggregate is affected by its specific gravity, shape, size, and grading. Determining the bulk density of aggregates is essential in concrete mix design to ensure the correct volume of aggregates and to evaluate the quality of the material.

Bulk density is used to:
1. Judge the quality of aggregates.
2. Convert proportions by mass into proportions by volume.
3. Calculate the percentage of voids in aggregates.

### **Formula for Bulk Density:**

**Bulk Density** = Mass of Aggregate in Container (kg) / Volume of Container (litres)

### **Formula for Percentage of Voids:**

**Percentage of Voids** = ((G_s - Y) / G_s) * 100

Where:
- **G_s** is the specific gravity of the aggregate
- **Y** is the bulk density of the aggregate

## Procedure

1. **Determining Volume of Container:**
   - Fill the container with water at 16.7°C and weigh the filled container. The mass of water in kg will give the volume of the container in litres.  
   - Use a **3L container** for aggregates under 4.75 mm, **15L container** for aggregates from 4.75 mm to 40 mm, and **30L container** for aggregates larger than 40 mm.

2. **Quartering the Sample:**
   - Take a representative sample of the aggregate by quartering.

3. **Loose Mass Determination:**
   - Fill the container with the aggregate to overflowing using a shovel, holding it no more than 50 mm above the container.
   - Level off the surface with a straight edge.
   - Weigh the container full of aggregate.

4. **Compacted Mass Determination:**
   - Fill the container with the aggregate in three layers. Each layer should be tamped with 25 strokes of the tamping rod. The strokes should be evenly distributed over the surface.
   - Fill the container to overflowing.
   - Strike off the excess aggregate using the tamping rod as a straight edge.
   - Weigh the container full of aggregate.

5. **Calculating Bulk Density:**
   - For both compact and loose mass determinations, calculate the net mass of the aggregate in the container and compute the bulk density by dividing the net mass by the volume of the container.

6. **Calculating Percentage of Voids:**
   - Calculate the percentage of voids using the formula mentioned above, where **G_s** is the specific gravity of the aggregate.

## Precautions

- Ensure that the container volume is accurately determined by filling it with water and measuring the mass.
- During the tamping process, the strokes should be evenly distributed, and no force should be applied to the bottom of the container.
- In the loose mass determination, take care to prevent segregation of particle sizes.
- Avoid evaporation of water during the calibration of the container.
- Ensure the sample is free from dust and dirt to avoid errors in measurement.

## Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

The bulk density of aggregates is crucial in determining the type of concrete for a project, as well as converting mass proportions into volume proportions. Different aggregate types and sizes have varying bulk densities and void percentages, which affect the overall concrete mix design. Fine aggregates generally have higher bulk density than coarse aggregates due to the differences in their packing characteristics.

## Questions (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

- What factors affect the bulk density of aggregates?
- How does the bulk density of coarse and fine aggregates differ?
- How is bulk density useful in concrete mix design?
- Why is it necessary to use different sized containers for different types of aggregates?
