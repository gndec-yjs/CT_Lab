## Objective

To determine the fineness of a cement sample by sieving it through a 90-micron IS sieve.

---

### IS Code:
**IS 4031 (Part 1): 1996 (Reaffirmed 2021)**  
*Method of Physical Tests for Hydraulic Cement – Part 1: Fineness by Dry Sieving*

---
## Apparatus Required

- 90-micron IS sieve (mesh opening 0.087 mm)  
- Weighing balance (accuracy: 0.1 g)  
- Rice plate  
- Bristle brush (25–40 mm width with 250 mm handle)  

---

## Theory

Fineness refers to the average particle size of cement. Finer cement hydrates faster and gains early strength, but may lead to increased shrinkage and cracking. The rate of hydration and workability of concrete is significantly affected by the fineness of cement.

This test involves passing cement through a 90-micron IS sieve. A correction factor (C) is used, based on BIS standardized cement. Finer cement offers more surface area for hydration, aiding early strength development.

## Procedure

1. Accurately weigh 100 g of cement and transfer it to the sieve. Break any air-set lumps with fingers.
2. Sieve with gentle wrist motion for 3–4 minutes, until most fine particles pass through.
3. Cover the sieve and tap it gently using the brush handle to help the remaining particles pass.
4. Return any material from the cover back into the sieve.
5. Continue sieving for a total of 15 minutes, rotating the sieve throughout.
6. Weigh the residue left on the sieve.

## Observations and Calculations

| Description                              | Value      |
|------------------------------------------|------------|
| Correction Factor (C)                    | ________   |
| Mass of cement taken                     | 100 g      |
| Mass of residue after sieving            | ________ g |
| Corrected residue (Residue ± C)          | ________ g |
| Fineness (%) = (Corrected Residue / 100) × 100 | ________ % |

---

## Result

Residue of cement on the 90-micron IS sieve = ________ %

---

## Precautions

- Break air-set lumps gently with fingers; do not rub on sieve.
- Clean the sieve thoroughly before and after the experiment.
- Avoid spilling cement and collect all residue for accurate weighing.

## Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

This test determines the amount of coarse particles in cement. For a complete understanding of fineness, specific surface area is considered, measured using:
1. Air Permeability Method (commonly used)  
2. Wagner’s Turbidimeter Method  

Improper grinding leads to poor workability and bleeding in concrete. BIS standards specify:

**Maximum residue on 90-micron IS sieve:**
- Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC): 10%  
- Rapid Hardening Cement (RHC): 5%

**Minimum specific surface area (cm²/g):**
- OPC: 2250  
- RHC: 3250  
- Low Heat Cement: 3200
