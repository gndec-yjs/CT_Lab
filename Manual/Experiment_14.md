## **Theory**

Workability refers to the ease with which concrete can be mixed, placed, compacted, and finished. The compaction factor test evaluates workability based on the degree of compaction achieved by free-fall under gravity. This test is especially useful for concrete with low to medium workability.

**Compaction Factor (CF)** is defined as:

> **CF = (Weight of partially compacted concrete) / (Weight of fully compacted concrete)**

Higher values of compaction factor indicate higher workability.

---

## **Procedure**

1. Ensure the apparatus is clean and free from any hardened concrete.
2. Close the trap doors of both hoppers (A and B).
3. Fill Hopper A with freshly mixed concrete and level the top surface without compaction.
4. Open the trap door of Hopper A to allow concrete to fall into Hopper B.
5. Immediately open the trap door of Hopper B, letting concrete fall into the cylinder (C).
6. Cut off excess concrete at the top of the cylinder using a trowel or steel straightedge.
7. Weigh the concrete in the cylinder (W₁) – this is partially compacted concrete.
8. Refill the cylinder with the same concrete in layers, each compacted with proper tamping or vibration to achieve full compaction.
9. Level and weigh the fully compacted concrete (W₂).
10. Calculate the compaction factor:

> **Compaction Factor (CF) = W₁ / W₂**

## **Observations and Calculations**

| Trial No. | Weight of Partially Compacted Concrete (kg) | Weight of Fully Compacted Concrete (kg) | Compaction Factor |
| --------: | ------------------------------------------: | --------------------------------------: | ----------------: |
|         1 |                                             |                                         |                   |
|         2 |                                             |                                         |                   |
|  **Avg.** |                                             |                                         |                   |

## **Result**

* **Average Compaction Factor** = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* Based on the compaction factor, the workability of the concrete is classified as:
  ▪ Very Low / Low / Medium / High (choose as applicable)

---

## **Precautions**

* Ensure the apparatus is cleaned and oiled to avoid sticking.
* Do not compact the concrete during the initial filling.
* Operate trap doors quickly to allow concrete to fall freely.
* Weigh the cylinder accurately for both conditions.
* Use the same concrete batch for both parts of the test.

---

## **Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)**

This test provides a quantitative measure of the workability of concrete and is especially suitable for mixes that are too dry for the slump test. A higher compaction factor indicates better workability, which can influence placing and compaction on site.

---

## **Questions (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)**

* What is the range of compaction factor values for workable concrete?
* How does the compaction factor relate to concrete consistency?
* When is this test preferred over the slump test?
* What would be the effect of poor compaction on concrete strength?
