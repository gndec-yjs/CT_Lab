To determine the fineness modulus (FM) of fine and coarse aggregates.

---

### IS Code:
**IS: 2386 (Part I) – 1963**  
*Methods of Test for Aggregates for Concrete – Part I: Particle Size and Shape*

---

## Apparatus Required

- Sieve set (consisting of sieves with standard openings)  
- Weighing balance (capacity of 5 kg or more, accurate to 0.1 gm)  
- Sample of fine and coarse aggregates  
- Mechanical sieve shaker (optional)  
- Sieves (coarse aggregates: 80 mm, 40 mm, 20 mm, 10 mm, 4.75 mm; fine aggregates: 4.75 mm, 2.36 mm, 1.18 mm, 300 µm, 150 µm, 600 µm)  
- Brush (for cleaning sieves)

## Theory

The fineness modulus (FM) is a measure of the average size of particles in an aggregate sample. It is calculated by adding the cumulative percentages of aggregates retained on each sieve, dividing the sum by 100. The fineness modulus is used to characterize the particle size distribution of fine and coarse aggregates. It helps in selecting the appropriate aggregates for concrete mix design and indicates the type of mix (coarse or fine).

## Procedure

1. **Preparation of Sample:**
   - Take a sample of the fine or coarse aggregate as per the standard quantity specified in the IS code (usually 500 grams to 1 kg for fine aggregates, and larger for coarse aggregates).

2. **Sieve the Aggregate:**
   - Place the sample on the top sieve and set the sieves in descending order (larger openings at the top). 
   - Start the sieving process, either by hand or using a mechanical sieve shaker, for about 10-15 minutes.
   - After sieving, weigh the amount of aggregate retained on each sieve.

3. **Calculating the Cumulative Percentage:**
   - For each sieve, calculate the percentage of aggregate retained using the formula:
   
     Percentage Retained = (Mass Retained on Sieve ÷ Total Mass of Sample) × 100

   - Calculate the cumulative percentage retained on each sieve, starting from the top sieve (coarse side).

4. **Calculating the Fineness Modulus:**
   - Add the cumulative percentages of the aggregates retained on each sieve and divide by 100.

5. **Repeat for Fine and Coarse Aggregates:**
   - Perform the sieve analysis and fineness modulus determination separately for fine aggregates (such as sand) and coarse aggregates (such as crushed stone).

## Precautions

- Ensure the sieves are clean and dry before use.
- Properly shake or agitate the sieve for a sufficient time to ensure accurate separation.
- Weigh the aggregate retained on each sieve accurately to avoid errors in the calculation.
- Use a sample that is representative of the bulk material.
- Avoid over-sieving, as this can lead to incorrect results.

## Result

- **Fineness Modulus of Fine Aggregate** = __________  
- **Fineness Modulus of Coarse Aggregate** = __________

## Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

The fineness modulus provides an indication of the coarseness or fineness of the aggregate. A high fineness modulus indicates a coarse aggregate, while a low fineness modulus indicates a fine aggregate. The fineness modulus is an essential parameter in the concrete mix design, as it helps in determining the appropriate proportions of fine and coarse aggregates for achieving the desired workability and strength in concrete.

## Questions (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

- How does the fineness modulus affect the mix design of concrete?
- What does the fineness modulus indicate about the particle size distribution of the aggregate?
- How would you interpret the fineness modulus values for fine and coarse aggregates? 
- Why is it important to sieve aggregates accurately during this test?
