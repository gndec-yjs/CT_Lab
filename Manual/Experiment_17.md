## **Theory**

Split tensile strength test is an indirect method for determining the tensile strength of concrete. A cylindrical concrete specimen is placed horizontally in a CTM, and a compressive load is applied along its vertical diameter. This loading induces a uniform tensile stress perpendicular to the direction of the applied load, causing the cylinder to split along the diameter.

Split tensile strength is crucial for evaluating the resistance of concrete to cracking under tensile loads, which are common in real structures but difficult to test directly.

The tensile strength is calculated using the formula:

**Split Tensile Strength (T):**

*T = (2P) / (π × D × L)*

Where:

* *T* = Split tensile strength in N/mm²
* *P* = Failure load in N
* *D* = Diameter of the cylinder in mm
* *L* = Length (height) of the cylinder in mm

## **Procedure**

1. Take the cast and cured concrete cylinders (usually 150 mm diameter × 300 mm height).
2. Measure the diameter and height of each specimen accurately using a vernier caliper.
3. Place the cylinder horizontally between the platens of the CTM.
4. Use steel bearing strips (12 mm wide) placed at the top and bottom along the length of the specimen.
5. Apply the load uniformly and continuously without shock at a constant rate of 1.2 MPa/min to 2.4 MPa/min.
6. Note the maximum load at which the specimen fails (splits).
7. Calculate the split tensile strength using the above formula.

## **Observations and Calculations**

| Cylinder No. | Age of Testing (days) | Diameter (mm) | Height (mm) | Failure Load (N) | Split Tensile Strength (N/mm²) |
| -----------: | --------------------: | ------------- | ----------- | ---------------: | -----------------------------: |
|            1 |                       |               |             |                  |                                |

|            3 |                       |               |             |                  |                                |
|     **Avg.** |                       |               |             |                  |                                |

## **Result**

* The **average split tensile strength of concrete cylinders** = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ N/mm²

---

## **Precautions**

* Ensure accurate dimensions of cylinders before testing.
* Use packing strips properly aligned with the load axis.
* Load should be applied uniformly without shock.
* Avoid eccentric loading.
* Specimens should be properly cured before testing.

## **Discussion** *(For reference only; not to be written in notebook)*

This test helps assess the tensile capacity of concrete indirectly, which is critical for understanding crack formation in concrete members. Unlike compressive tests, split tensile strength reflects concrete's behavior under real service conditions where tensile stresses are often present.

## **Questions** *(For reference only; not to be written in notebook)*

* Why is the split tensile test considered indirect?
* What are the typical values of split tensile strength for M20, M25, and M30 concrete?
* How does curing affect tensile strength?
* What would happen if packing strips are not used?
* Why is tensile strength important in structural concrete?
