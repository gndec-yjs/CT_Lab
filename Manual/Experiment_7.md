## Objective

To determine the specific gravity and water absorption of coarse aggregates.

---

### IS Code:
**IS: 2386 (Part III) – 1963**  
*Methods of Test for Aggregates for Concrete – Part III: Specific Gravity, Density, Voids, Absorption, and Bulking*

---

## Apparatus Required

- Balance of capacity 5 kg or more (sensitive to 0.5 gm)  
- Weight box  
- Wire basket (200 mm in diameter and 200 mm height with 4.75 mm IS sieve net)  
- Water tub for immersing the wire basket in water  
- Suitable arrangement for suspending the wire basket from the center of the scale pan of the balance  
- Absorbent cloth for surface drying of the sample

## Theory

Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of an aggregate to the mass of an equal volume of water. It provides valuable information about the quality of the aggregate. The water absorption of aggregates is important as it impacts the workability and strength of the concrete. High absorption can affect the mixture's water content and thus its performance.

**Formulas:**  
- **Specific Gravity (Bulk)** = \( \frac{W_1}{W_1 - (W_3 - W_2)} \)  
- **Apparent Specific Gravity** = \( \frac{W_4}{W_4 - (W_3 - W_2)} \)  
- **Absorption (%)** = \( \frac{W_1 - W_4}{W_4} \times 100 \)  

Where:  
\( W_1 \) = mass of saturated surface dry sample (g)  
\( W_2 \) = mass of basket suspended in water (g)  
\( W_3 \) = mass of material + basket suspended in water (g)  
\( W_4 \) = mass of oven-dried sample (g)

## Procedure

1. Take about 5 kg of coarse aggregate by the method of quartering, rejecting all material passing a 10 mm IS sieve.  
2. Wash thoroughly to remove dust and other fine particles from the surface.  
3. Dry the sample to constant mass in an oven at 100–110°C for 24 hours.  
4. Immerse the sample in water at 22–32°C for 24 ± 0.5 hours.  
5. After 24 hours, remove the sample from the water and roll it in a towel to remove visible surface water.  
6. Weigh the sample in its saturated surface dry condition, and record it as \( W_1 \).  
7. Suspend the sample in the wire basket and immerse it in water. Weigh it again and record it as \( W_3 \).  
8. Dry the sample again in the oven at 100–110°C for 24 hours.  
9. After drying, cool the sample to room temperature and weigh it again. Record this as \( W_4 \).

## Result

- **Specific Gravity of Coarse Aggregate (Bulk)** = ________  
- **Apparent Specific Gravity** = ________  
- **Absorption of Coarse Aggregate** = ________ %

## Precautions

- Ensure the mass of the sample is accurate at all stages, and measure to the nearest 0.5 gm.  
- Clean the wire basket and other apparatus before each use.  
- The sample should be free of any foreign materials.  
- Ensure the aggregate is saturated but surface dry during weighing.  
- Avoid evaporation during the surface drying process.

## Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

The specific gravity of the coarse aggregate reflects its density and quality. Higher specific gravity indicates that the aggregate is denser and of better quality. The water absorption test provides information on the porosity of the aggregate, affecting the concrete’s workability and strength.

## Questions (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

- What are the uses of determining specific gravity in concrete mix design?  
- How does water absorption influence the strength and workability of concrete?  
- Why is it important to ensure that the sample is saturated and surface dry before weighing?  
- What could be the possible reasons for variation in specific gravity readings?
