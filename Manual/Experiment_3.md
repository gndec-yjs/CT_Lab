## Theory

Soundness of cement refers to its ability to retain volume after setting. Unsoundness is caused by excess free lime or magnesia, which hydrate slowly and cause expansion, leading to cracks and loss of durability. The Le-Chatelier method uses accelerated heat treatment to measure this expansion. If expansion is excessive, the cement is considered unsound and not suitable for construction.

As per IS: 269-1976, the permissible expansion should not exceed **10 mm** for OPC.

---

## Procedure

1. Take 100 g of cement and gauge it with 0.78 times the water required for standard consistency (~30% water).  
2. Fill the Le-Chatelier mould placed on a glass plate with the paste and level it.  
3. Cover with another glass plate and place a small weight to keep it steady.  
4. Immediately immerse the assembly in water at **29 ± 2°C** for **24 hours**.  
5. Measure the distance between the indicator points (**D₁**).  
6. Re-immerse the mould in water and heat to boiling within **25–30 minutes**.  
7. Boil for **3 hours**, cool it, and measure the new distance between the indicator points (**D₂**).  
8. Calculate expansion:  
   **Expansion = D₂ – D₁**

## Observations and Calculations

| Description                              | Value      |
|------------------------------------------|------------|
| Initial distance between indicator ends (D₁)   | ________ mm |
| FInal distance between indicator ends after boiling (D₂)              | ________ mm |
| **Expansion = D₂ – D₁**                  | ________ mm |

---

## Result

Expansion of cement sample = ________ mm  
(Should be **≤ 10 mm** for OPC as per IS: 269)

---

## Precautions

- Mix the cement paste thoroughly for at least one minute.  
- Place the filled mould in the water bath **immediately** after covering.  
- Ensure water level remains above the mould throughout boiling.  
- Cool the mould completely before taking final reading.  
- Clean the apparatus before and after the test.

## Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

This test checks for delayed expansion due to unsound materials like free lime and magnesia. If the expansion exceeds IS limits, the cement may cause cracking in the hardened structure. In case of failure, cement may be aerated for 7 days and retested. The new permissible expansion is then limited to **5 mm**.
