## Theory

Compressive strength is one of the most important properties of concrete, representing its ability to resist axial loads. It is determined by applying a gradually increasing load on a concrete specimen until it fails. The failure load divided by the cross-sectional area gives the compressive strength.

The compressive strength is calculated using the following formula:


f<sub>ck</sub> = P / A


Where:

* *f<sub>ck</sub>* = Compressive strength (N/mm² or MPa)
* *P* = Maximum load at failure (N)
* *A* = Loaded cross-sectional area of the specimen (mm²)

## Procedure

1. Prepare standard concrete cube and cylinder specimens.
2. Cure the specimens in water at 27 ± 2°C for 7 or 28 days.
3. Remove the specimens from curing and allow surface moisture to evaporate.
4. Measure and record the dimensions of each specimen using a caliper.
5. Place the specimen centrally on the compression testing machine (CTM).
6. Apply load gradually at a uniform rate of **140 kg/cm²/min (≈14 N/mm²/min)** until failure.
7. Record the maximum load at failure.
8. Calculate the compressive strength using the formula above.
9. Repeat for all specimens and calculate the average strength.

## Result

* Average compressive strength of cubes = **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ MPa**
* Average compressive strength of cylinders = **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ MPa**

---

## Precautions

* Ensure proper alignment of specimen in CTM before applying load.
* Do not apply shock loading; maintain a uniform rate of loading.
* Specimens should be cured properly before testing.
* Remove surface moisture before placing specimens in the machine.
* Check calibration of CTM regularly.
* Avoid parallax error while reading load dial or digital display.

## Discussion (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

Compressive strength is critical in mix design and quality control of concrete structures. Cylinders typically show lower strength than cubes due to the slenderness effect and end restraint conditions. The test is a primary benchmark for acceptance of concrete work on site.

---

## Questions (For reference only; not to be written in notebook)

* Why do cylinder specimens show lower strength than cubes?
* What are standard curing conditions for concrete specimens?
* How does the loading rate affect the compressive strength?
* What precautions must be taken during testing?
* What is the significance of 7-day and 28-day strength?
* Can compressive strength predict durability?
