## **Objective**

To design a concrete mix using the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) method as per the latest IS code.

---

## **IS Code**

**IS: 10262:2019** *(Reaffirmed 2023)*
*“Concrete Mix Proportioning – Guidelines”*

Also refers to:

* **IS: 456:2000** *(Plain and Reinforced Concrete – Code of Practice)*
* **IS: 383:2016** *(Coarse and Fine Aggregate Specifications)*
* **IS: 1199 (Part 1 to 8): 2018** *(Fresh Concrete Testing Methods)*

---

## **Apparatus Required**

* Measuring jars or graduated cylinders
* Weighing balance
* Moisture content testing tools
* Slump cone
* Mixing pan or concrete mixer

---

## **Theory**

The **BIS method of concrete mix design** aims to achieve a concrete mix with:

* Required workability
* Target mean strength
* Adequate durability
* Economical proportions

Key considerations:

* Grade of concrete
* Type and size of aggregates
* Exposure conditions
* Type of cement
* Water-cement ratio
* Admixtures (if any)

---

## **Procedure**

1. **Select Grade of Concrete**
   Example: M20, M30, etc.

2. **Calculate Target Mean Strength**

   ```markdown
   Target Mean Strength, ft = fck + t × S
   ```

   * *fck* = Characteristic compressive strength (e.g., 20 MPa for M20)
   * *S* = Standard deviation (from IS 10262:2019, Table 2)
   * *t* = Tolerance factor (based on control quality)

3. **Select Water-Cement Ratio**
   Refer to IS 456:2000, Table 5 based on durability and exposure.

4. **Determine Water Content**
   From IS 10262:2019, Table 4 depending on nominal maximum size of aggregate and desired workability.

5. **Determine Cement Content**

   ```markdown
   Cement Content = Water Content / Water-Cement Ratio
   ```

6. **Check Minimum Cement Content for Durability**
   As per IS 456:2000, Table 5

7. **Determine Aggregate Proportions**
   Based on:

   * Nominal max. size of aggregates
   * Zone of fine aggregate (IS 383:2016)
   * IS 10262:2019, Table 5

8. **Adjust for Moisture and Absorption**

   ```markdown
   Adjusted Water = Required Water - (Moisture Content × Weight of Aggregate)
   Adjusted Aggregate Weight = Measured Weight + (Absorbed Moisture %)
   ```

9. **Calculate Mix Per Cubic Meter of Concrete**
   Final values in kg/m³ for each material.

## **Observations and Calculations**

| Parameter                           | Value            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Grade of Concrete                   | M\_\_\_\_        |
| Target Mean Strength (ft)           | \_\_\_\_\_\_ MPa |
| W/C Ratio (Selected)                | \_\_\_\_\_\_     |
| Water Content (kg/m³)               | \_\_\_\_\_\_     |
| Cement Content (kg/m³)              | \_\_\_\_\_\_     |
| Fine Aggregate (kg/m³)              | \_\_\_\_\_\_     |
| Coarse Aggregate (kg/m³)            | \_\_\_\_\_\_     |
| Admixture (% by weight of cement)   | \_\_\_\_\_\_     |
| Adjustments for Moisture/Absorption | Applied          |

## **Result**

**Final Concrete Mix Proportion (by weight):**

```markdown
Cement : Fine Aggregate : Coarse Aggregate : Water  
1 : ___ : ___ : ___
```

> *(With \_\_\_\_% admixture by weight of cement, if used)*

---

## **Precautions**

* Ensure correct moisture corrections.
* Use properly graded and tested aggregates.
* Choose appropriate w/c ratio and admixtures.
* Follow IS: 10262:2019 guidelines strictly.
* Use standard calibrated tools and accurate measurements.

## **Discussion (Not to be written in notebook)**

This experiment helps students understand the systematic approach to mix proportioning considering all practical parameters. Accurate mix design ensures durable, workable, and economical concrete.

---

## **Questions (Not to be written in notebook)**

* How does standard deviation affect target mean strength?
* Why are admixtures used in mix design?
* What is the impact of water-cement ratio on concrete strength?
* How is moisture correction done?
