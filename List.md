|:----|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Evaluate properties of building materials, such as cement and aggregates.           |
| 2   | Conduct experiments to check the acceptance criteria (if any).                      |
| 3   | Design concrete mixes as per BIS provisions.                                        |
| 4   | Analyze the properties of concrete in fresh and hardened state.                     |
| 5   | Create a well organized document and present the results appropriately.             |
| 6   | Understand and apply non destructive testing (NDT) for evaluating concrete quality. |
